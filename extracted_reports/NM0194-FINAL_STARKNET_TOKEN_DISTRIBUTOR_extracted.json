      "severity": "Info",
      "summary": "The $STRK address is hardcoded to its address on the Sepolia testnet, which may differ on the mainnet and would require manual checks and code changes before deployment."

      "title": "Low Trust on Alexandria Merkle Tree Library",

      "summary": "There exists an external dependency from the Alexandria library which has not undergone an audit, raising concerns about the overall integrity and reliability of the system."

      "title": "Possible Hash Collision When Calculating the Hash of Leaves",
      "severity": "Info",
      "summary": "The leaf of the Merkle tree is computed in a way that could theoretically allow an attacker to provide a combination leading to a valid claim, which could drain the contract. This was fixed by changing the hashing method."

      "severity": "Best Practices",
      "summary": "The current coding style imports external libraries one by one on a single line, which does not align with best coding practices. It's recommended to consolidate these imports to improve readability and maintainability."

      "summary": "The contract initially used Pedersen hashing, which is resource-intensive. It's recommended to switch to Poseidon hashing for efficiency. This change has been implemented."
