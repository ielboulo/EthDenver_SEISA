# some of my notes - Spencer

## ui/ux
- i think a chrome extension might take too long for hackathon scope but we can discuss UI/UX later and see what is feasible in short time frame.

## libraries that might be relevant?
- Rust Zero-Knowledge Proofs: [zkMIPS](https://github.com/zkMIPS/zkm/)
- Python Zero-Knowledge Proofs: [PyZPK](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyZPK/)


## PDF notes
- question : do we intend to do PDF parsing on audit reports. if so we need some OCR libraries.
- Lots of options availible for that such as Tesseract (open-source), ocr.space (cloud API), or Amazon Textract (AWS service)
